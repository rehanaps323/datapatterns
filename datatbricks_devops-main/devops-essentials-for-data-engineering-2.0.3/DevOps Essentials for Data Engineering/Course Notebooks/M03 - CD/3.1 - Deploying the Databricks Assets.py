# MAGIC # 3.1 - Deploying the Databricks Assets
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In Databricks, you have several options for deploying your Databricks Assets such as the UI, REST APIs, Databricks CLI, Databricks SDK or Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs). Databricks recommends Databricks Asset Bundles for creating, developing, deploying, and testing jobs and other Databricks resources as source code. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demonstration, we will deploy our project and explore the job and pipeline using the Workflows UI. Then, we will examine the Workflow JSON and YAML structures and discuss how we can use these within our CI/CD process.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Objectives
# MAGIC - Deploy Databricks assets using the Databricks SDK. 
# MAGIC - Analyze the Workflow JSON and YAML definitions for jobs and tasks, and explore their role in enabling automated deployment.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.

# MAGIC ## B. Create the Databricks Job with Notebooks, Python Files and DLT
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. In this section, we will create the job for our project. The job will contain the following tasks:
# MAGIC - Unit tests
# MAGIC - DLT pipeline with the ETL pipeline and integration tests 
# MAGIC - Final data visualization deliverable for this project
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **FINAL JOB**

# MAGIC ![Final SDK Workflow](../Includes/images/05_final_sdk_workflow.png)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 2. During development, it's beneficial to build out your Workflow and/or DLT Pipeline using the UI. The UI provides an easy way to build your desired job, and it generates the necessary JSON or YAML files to start automating your deployment across different environments.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     **NOTE:** In the cell below, we will create the job using custom functions provided by Databricks Academy, which leverages the Databricks SDK behind the scenes. **This approach saves time in class by avoiding the need to manually create the Workflow using the UI for the demonstration. Workflows are a prerequisite for this course.**

# COMMAND ----------

## Confirm the pipeline from the previous demonstration exists. If not, create the DLT pipeline and store the ID
my_pipeline_id = obtain_pipeline_id_or_create_if_not_exists()
print(my_pipeline_id)

# ## Create the job
create_demo_5_job(my_pipeline_id = my_pipeline_id, job_name = f'Dev Workflow Using the SDK_{DA.catalog_name}')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 3. Complete the following steps to view and run the new job:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     a. In the far-left navigation bar, right-click on **Workflows** and select *Open Link in New Tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     b. In the **Jobs** tab, you should see a job named **Dev Workflow Using the SDK_user_name**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     c. Select the job **Dev Workflow Using the SDK_user_name**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     d. Select on **Run now** to run the job.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     e. Leave the job open.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 4. While the job is running, explore the job tasks. The job will take between 5-7 minutes to complete. Navigate to the job **Runs** tab. Here you should see the job executing.

# MAGIC ## Next Steps for CI/CD
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Think about the following for the deploying this project utilizing the entire CI/CD process:
# MAGIC - How will I automatically deploy the databricks assets to run for **dev**, **stage**, and **prod** environments?
# MAGIC - How do I parameterize all the values I need based on the target environment?
# MAGIC - How do I configure the necessary variables for the DLT pipeline during each deployment?
# MAGIC - How do I maintain all of the code?
# MAGIC - How do I automate this entire process?
# MAGIC - How can I setup continuous integration and continuous delivery or deployment (CI/CD) system, such as GitHub Actions, to automatically run your unit tests whenever your code changes? For an example, see the coverage of GitHub Actions in [Software engineering best practices for notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/notebooks/best-practices.html).
